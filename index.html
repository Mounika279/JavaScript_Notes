  <h3 style="color:#ff9800;">What is JS?</h3>
  <p>JS gives life for the page.It is used for Dynamic functionality.<br>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
   js will execute line by line after completing and execyting one line it will go to another line if there is
  any error then it will stop there.<br>so it is called as <b>Single Threaded language</b><br><br>
<b style="color: burlywood;">For example:</b>To clearly understand and remember why is js single threaded??
If we want to prepare any sweet so we will take carrot halwa as example We dont fry the carrots and do right <br>
there is a certain process to do step by step we will first remove layer and then we will grate it and so on... so step by step 
to remember easily i have took example carrothalwa as example.<br>
<h3 style="color: yellowgreen;">What is Complier?</h3>
In simple words,human to machine understandable language.
<h3 style="color: gold;">What is interpretor?</h3>
  <p>An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it.</p>
<h3 style="color:khaki">What is Framework?</h3>
Collection of library is called framework.<br>
<b>Example</b>:Angular,React...
<h3 style="color: lime;"> What is Library?</h3>
Javascript libraries is a file that contains a set of prewritten functions or codes that you can repeatedly use while executing JavaScript tasks.
<h3 style="color: navajowhite;">Synchronous and Asynchronous in JavaScript &#129300</h3>
<b style="color: navajowhite;">Synchronous</b>
synchronous means to be in a sequence, i.e. every statement of the code gets executed one by one. So, basically a statement has to wait for the earlier statement to get executed.<br>
<b style="color: navajowhite;">Example:</b><br>
console.log('First');<br>
console.log('Second');<br>
console.log('Third');<br><br>
<b style="color: navajowhite;">Output:</b><br><br>
First<br>
Second<br>
Third<br><br>
<b style="color: navajowhite;">Asynchronous</b>
Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed immediately whereas the synchronous code will block further execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one.<br>
 This may not look like a big problem but when you see it in a bigger picture you realize that it may lead to delaying the User Interface.It will run parallely.<br>
 <b style="color: navajowhite;">Example</b><br>
 console.log('first');<br>
 setTimeout(function(){
    console.log("second");
},0)
console.log('third')<br><br>
<b style="color: navajowhite;">OUTPUT:</b><br><br>
first<br>
third<br>
second<br>
 </p>
 <table class="table table-bordered ">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody id="myTable">
      <tr>
        <td>Every statement in a function is executed sequentially. </td>
        <td>Every statement in a function is not executed sequentially. It can also execute in parallel. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The execution of the next instruction depends upon the execution of the previous instruction. </td>
        <td>The next instruction can execute while the previous one is still executing.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Synchronous is a single thread.</td>
        <td>Asynchronous is multi-thread in nature. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Synchronous is slower in nature.</td>
        <td>Asynchronous increases throughout as processes run in parallel.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h3 style="color: mediumturquoise;">what is console?&#128528;</h3>
  <p>It prints output.<br>The log() method writes (logs) a message to the console.It is used for testing purpose.<br>
    <b style="color: mediumturquoise;">SYNTAX:</b><br>
    console.log(message);<br><br>
    <b style="color: mediumturquoise;">Example:</b><br>
    const first = 'Pandu';<br>
    const last= 'Mounika';<br>
    console.log(first + ' ' + name);<br><br>
    <b style="color: mediumturquoise;">OUTPUT:</b><br>
    Pandu Mounika
</p>
<h3 style="color: mediumvioletred;">Client-Server Model:</h3>
<img src="./client-serve.png"height="200px" width="200px"><br><br>
We will take a example of restaurant for CS Model,<br>
Client-Seated person who comes to restaurant<br>
Server-Who prepares food (Kitchen)<br>
API-Waiter<br>
when the client(person) orders food,the order will be accepted by (server) who prepares 
food,so client will request for food and server will give response.<br><br>
Client request sent &#x2192;&#8592;server gives response

<div id="section2" class="container-fluid">
  <h2 style="color: gold;">Common features in programming Languages</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: larger;">
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>Datatypes</li>
    <li>Operators</li>
    <li>Control structures</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="color: limegreen;">VARIABLES &#129300;</h3>
  <p>Variable are container which is used to store data.(or)<br>
    To store data temporarily we have a concept variables
  </p>
  <h3 style="color:mediumspringgreen">DATATYPES &#129300;</h3>
  <p>A data type is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value.
    <br>Datatypes have different types:
    <ul>
        <li>Alphabets</li>-Collection pf characters in quotation is called string('') or("")
        <li>Numbers</li>- (0-9)
        <li>Boolean</li>- (True or False)
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3 style="color:khaki">&#129488;Primitive & Non-primitive Datatypes &#129488;</h3><br>
  <p><b style="color:khaki">PRIMITIVE:</b>Primitive data types are basic and include such values as integers, boolean, characters and other simple stored memory types.</p>
  <p><b style="color:khaki">NON-PRIMITIVE:</b>Nonprimitive data types are more complex values such as strings, objects, and arrays. </p>  
  <b style="color:khaki">Example 1:</b><br>
  int a=10;---this is static(Means it is fixed and here a refer to integer)<br>
  a="Hello";---this is assigning<br>
  <img src="./value store.jpg" height="150" width="150"><br><br>
  So from the above image if we are storing a=10 then it will take only int value only 
  because we have assigned it while declaring a is 10.<br><br>
  <b style="color:khaki">Example 2:</b><br>
  a=10-----;a=hello---(these are dynamic)<br><br>
  <b style="color: coral;">*In javascript we particularly name it as which type of number..
    it will allow all types,but in java we should specify particularly which type of
    number is it
  </b>
  <h3>OPERATORS &#129488;</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Arthematic</li>--(=,-,*,/,%)
    <li>Assignment</li>--(=,â‰ ,==)(== it will check)
    <li>Logical</li>--(&&,||,!)
    <li>Comparisional</li>(>,=,>=)
  </ul>
  <h3>Control strcutures?? &#129488;&#129488;</h3>
  <p>It will control structures.</p>
  <b>LOOPING  &#129488;</b>
  <p>It will loop until we take further action on it.</p>
  <b>Example:</b>
  <p>choclate fountain--which we see in malls,theatres
    it will go on until we off the switch loop continues....
  </p>
  <h3>CONDITIONAL STATEMENT  &#129488;</h3>
  <p>It allow a program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false</p>
  <b>Example:</b>
  <p>"If the rug is dirty, then the rug should be vacuumed." "The rug is dirty" is the hypothesis, and "the rug should be vacuumed" is the conclusion.</p>
  <h2>FUNCTIONS &#129488;&#129300;</h2>
  <p>It is used for reusablity of code.Each function returns some value.Because of 
    reusablity the space will also reduce.
  </p>
  <b>Example:</b>
  <p style="font-size: medium;">Consider a garden,in which it has 10 plants and they are far to each other 
    so the gardener keeps each tank beside it by that when ever he goes to that certain plant
    he will take the water and pours water on it.....oops this is such a big process and takes
    much time and space as well.. what should i do now &#128580;<br>
    The best idea is keep a big tank which is sufficient for all the plants
    and keep a pipe line and connect to each plant so that whenever the gardener
    wants to plant water he just on it by this space and time will take less space as well
    as time.(This is called as <b>INVOCATION</b>)
    Time complexity--Less time
    Space complexity--Less space
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: medium";>ohhhhh Whats Invocation is it different from calling &#129300;</p>
  <p style="font-size: medium;">Noooo.... Both are same &#129321; Invocation--Calling a function when it is necessary</p>
 <h1 style="font-size: xx-large; color:gold">JAVASCRIPT&#129300;&#129300;&#129300;</h1>
  <h1 style="color:peru">WHAT??</h1>
  <h1  style="color:yellowgreen">WHERE??</h1>
  <h1  style="color: darkgreen;">WHY??</h1>
  <h1  style="color:rosybrown">HOW??</h1><br>
  <p style="color:peru; font-size: large;">WHAT---
    Javascript is a scripting language.We use interpretor in this,the lines in
    the code willmexecute line by line.When error comes it will stop.So it is called as<br>
    <b style="color: #00bcd4;">Single Threaded Synchronous Dynamically typed language</b>
</p>
<p style="color: yellowgreen;font-size: large;">WHERE---
    JS is used in both Frontend as well as Backend also.
</p>
<p style="color: darkgreen;font-size: large;">WHY---
    JavaScript is so versatile that you can use it to easily add cool design elements such as animation, interactive maps, and scrolling video.
</p>
<p style="color: rosybrown;font-size: large;">HOW--
    JS is used in internal and external.<br>
    Internal-Using script tag.
    External-In another file(index.js).
</p>
<h3 style="color:goldenrod">Defer???&#129296;</h3>
<p>If we use defer keyword then we can write script tag anywhere...If we are not Internal-Using
    then we have write at the last before body tag.
</p>
<h3 style="color:darkorange">BOM &#129320;</h3>
<p>Browser Object Model<br>
     It is a collection of objects exposed by the browser that allow JavaScript to
      interact with the browser window, document.
</p>
<h3 style="color: yellowgreen;">DOM &#129320;</h3>
<p>Document Object Model<br>
   It is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the
     page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
</p>
</div>
<div id="section3" class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Variables &#129320;</h1>
  <p>To store Data.It act as a container.Variables are categorised into 3 types:
    <ul>
        <li>Var</li>
        <li>Char</li>
        <li>Let</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
  <li> In this keywords,<b>VAR</b> is having life everywhere</li> 
  <li>In var we can re-assign<br>
EX:a=10,a="hello"</li>
<li>If we are not assigned any value to a variable then defaultly undefined will be assigned</li>
</ol>
  </p>
  <h3>Declaration</h3>
  <p>var a,Here we are assigning 10 in a variable name</p>
  <h3>Initialization</h3>
  <p>Var a=10,Initializing a in 10(var)</p>
  <h3>Assigning</h3>
  <p> i=0,Means 0 is assigned to i.It is used to assign a value to a variable or property</p>

<b>Declaration+Assigning=Initialization</b>
<h3>What is Hoisting&#129300;&#129300;</h3>
<p>Every declaration what we declared will go to the top of the page before execution
    (default Behaviour)</p>
<p>In terms of variables and constants, keyword var is hoisted and let and const does not allow hoisting.</p>
<img src="hoisting ex.png"height="200px"width="200">
<p>In the above example, variable a is used before declaring it. And the program works and displays the output 5.</p>
<h3>Console????&#129488;&#129488;&#129488;</h3>
<p>The Console can be used to log information as part of the JavaScript development process,
     as well as allow you to interact with a web page by carrying out JavaScript expressions within the page's context. </p>
<ul>
    <li>If there is an error in console,<br>
    For example:Conse.log(10)---It stops,it wont print.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is scope??&#128175;</h3>
<p>Life of a variable<br>There are 2 types of life:<br></p>
<ol>
    <li>Global</li>--Particular thing or person is having acessing everywhere.
    <li>LOcal</li>--It is having limited access.(Specific)
</ol>
